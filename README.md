### Hi! I'm Camilo 👋

I am a student of the M.Eng. in Telecommunication Engineering (Mention in Telematics 👨‍💻) at University of Vigo (Galicia, Spain). I am currently a Junior Engineer-Researcher at GRADIANT (Galician R&D Center in Advanced Telecommunications).

My main interests are Machine/Deep Learning, Data Analysis and software development.

I invite you to take a look at my repos, which cover mainly my university individual and group projects.
