### Hi! I'm Camilo 👋

I am a M.Eng. in Telecommunication Engineering (Mention in Telematics 👨‍💻) from University of Vigo (Galicia, Spain). I am currently working as a Reseacher-Engineer at GRADIANT (Galician R&D Center in Advanced Telecommunications).

My main interests are Data Analytics, Applied Machine and Deep Learning and MLOps.

I invite you to take a look at my repos, which cover mainly my university individual and group projects.
